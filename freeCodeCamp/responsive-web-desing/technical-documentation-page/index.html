                    <p>Conceived as the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the Death Star battle station is equipped with a planet-shattering superlaser. The station is heavily shielded, defended by TIE starfighters and laser cannons, and invested with firepower greater than that of half the Imperial fleet. The Empire’s diabolical leaders have every reason to believe that their technological terror will induce fear across the galaxy. But the Death Star has one flaw.
                        This Haynes Manual traces the origins of the Death Star, from concept to a top-secret project that begins before the foundation of the Empire, which draws design inspiration from the Trade Federation’s spherical warships. In this manual, the Death Star’s onboard systems and controls are explained in detail, and are illustrated with an astonishing range of computer-generated artwork, floor plans, cutaways, and exploded diagrams.
                        Covering history, development and prototyping, superstructure, energy and propulsion, weapons and defensive systems, hangar bays, security, service and technical sectors, crew facilities, and with information about the Death Star II and its planetary shield generator, this is the most thorough technical guide to the Death Star available.</p>
