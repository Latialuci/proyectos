                <p>Conceived as the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the Death Star battle station is equipped with a 
                    planet-shattering superlaser. The station is heavily shielded, defended by TIE starfighters 
                    and laser cannons, and invested with firepower greater than that of half the Imperial fleet. 
                    The Empire’s diabolical leaders have every reason to believe that their technological terror 
                    will induce fear across the galaxy. But the Death Star has one flaw.
                    This Haynes Manual traces the origins of the Death Star, from concept to a top-secret project 
                    that begins before the foundation of the Empire, which draws design inspiration from the Trade 
                    Federation’s spherical warships. In this manual, the Death Star’s onboard systems and controls 
                    are explained in detail, and are illustrated with an astonishing range of computer-generated artwork, 
                    floor plans, cutaways, and exploded diagrams.
                    Covering history, development and prototyping, superstructure, energy and propulsion, weapons and 
                    defensive systems, hangar bays, security, service and technical sectors, crew facilities, and with 
                    information about the Death Star II and its planetary shield generator, this is the most thorough 
                    technical guide to the Death Star available.</p>

                <header>Death Star Physical Layout</header> 
                <p>The Death Star was divided into 24 zones, 12 in each hemisphere. Each zone was similar to a subbattle station, had a bridge for coordinating all
                    zone functions, and was divided into a series of city sprawls.
                    Each zone had its own food replicators, hangar bays, detention blocks, medical centers, armories, command centers, and almost any other facility necessary to provide full services and
                    fulfill any mission at band. These facilities took up a large portion of the crust.</p>
                <p>A sprawl was a city with a complete array of sector-dedicated facilities - medical facilities,
                    mess halls, troop barracks, computer facilities, sensors, weaponry, security stations - which
                    together composed an entire community. Within each sprawl, command, general, military, security, and service/technical sectors provided all
                    necessary functions to the community, as well as coordinated activities throughout the Death Star.
                    Many of the sprawls were specialized, emphasizing one particular sector, and through coordination with all othersprawls in the zone, a complete
                    network of information exchange and unified activity was established. All of the "below surface" facilities within the crust of the Death Star
                    were considered part of the city sprawl</p>

                <header>Defstat levels</header>
                <p>The Death Star operated on a four-level defense status (or defstat) system. Defstat Zero was the normal state of the battle station, with
                    duty posts and defenses set at their regular level of day-to-day operations. When the battle station
                    was placed on Defstat One, it was on a first stage alert status. All defenses were upgraded to accommodate 
                    this higher level of alertness. If the Death Star was in the same sector of space as
                    enemy or unidentified craft, the station advanced to Defstat Two. The highest level of defense, set
                    during times of combat, was Defstat Three.</p>
                <p>Most Imperial facilities operate on a similar, if not identical, defstat system. Due to the enormous 
                    size of the Death Star and the particular nature of a threat, various zones and sprawls
                    could have been at different defstat levels. Defstat levels could also have been increased
                    or decreased on the basis of internal threats or disturbances. In these cases, Defstat increases
                    are normally restricted by zone and sector, with all areas outside the zone under Defstat Zero
                    unless it is believed the threat will be able to encroach upon adjoining sectors and zones.</p>
                <p>The following descriptions assume the characters have set off alarms within the base and are
                    the subject of a manhunt. If the base is under attack from outside forces, the amount of troop
                    activity increases, but the troops are preparing for battle and do not suspect that Rebels may
                    have actually penetrated the base.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>DefstatZero:</b> Normal level of alertness, no change in guard posts. Two-man security guard patrols
                            and remotes perform regular checks of the sector, arriving on the roll of 1 on a six-sided die (roll
                            every 10 minutes of game time). Patrols can be avoided with Easy sneak rolls. Locked doors are set at their normal difficulty
                            and require security rolls equal to or better than the difficulty number to gain access. If the security 
                            roll is less, the attempt fails and that character cannot make another attempt on that door. If
                            the security roll is half the difficulty number or less, the character fails and sets off an alarm,
                            immediately placing the sprawl on Defstat One.
                            Computer terminals are set at their normal difficulty. To defeat computer security and gain
                            access to restricted data, or to manipulate a computer terminal to shut down connected systems, a character
                            must make a computer programming roll equal to or better than the difficulty
                            number. If the roll is less, the attempt fails. If the roll is half the difficulty number or less, the
                            character not only fails, but sets off an alarm, immediately placing the sprawl on Defstat One.</li>
                        <li><b>Defstat One:</b> No change in guard posts. In addition to two-man security guard patrols and
                            remotes (which arrive on a roll of 1),stormtrooper squads begin patrolling (arriving on a roll of 2).
                            Stormtrooper squads are made up of one squad leader and seven troopers. Patrols can be avoided
                            with Moderate sneak rolls.
                            Increase the difficulty numbers of all locked doors (other than blast doors) by 2. If the security
                            roll is less, the attempt fails and that character cannot make another attempt on that door. If the
                            security roll is half the difficulty number or less, the character fails and sets off an alarm, immediately 
                            placing the sprawl and all adjoining sprawls on Defstat Two. In addition, guards will be routed
                            to that sprawl and all adjoining sprawls.
                            Increase the difficulty numbers of all computer stations by 2. If the computer programming
                            roll is less, the attempt fails. If the roll is half the difficulty number or less, the character fails and
                            sets off an alarm, immediately placing the sprawl and all nearby sprawls on Defstat Two.</li>
                        <li><b>Defstat Two:</b> Guard post personnel are doubled. In addition to two-man security guard patrols
                            and remotes (which arrive on a roll of 1), stormtrooper squads step up their patrols (arriving on a roll of 2 or 3). 
                            Patrols can be avoided with Difficult sneak rolls. Increase the difficulty numbers of all locked
                            doors (other than blast doors) by another 5. If the secunty roll is less, the attempt fails and that character 
                            cannot make another attempt on that door. If the security roll is half the difficulty number or less,
                            the character not only fails, he sets off an alarm, immediately placing the zone on Defstat Three.
                            Increase the difficulty numbers of all computer stations by another 5. If the computer programming roll is less, the attempt fails. If the roll
                            is half the difficulty number or less, the character not only fails, he sets off an alarm, immediately
                            placing the zone on Defstat Three</li>
                        <li><b>Defstat Three:</b> In addition to doubled personnel guard posts, two-man security guard patrols and
                            remotes (which arrive on a roll of 1), and stormtrooper squads (arriving on a roll of 2 or 3),
                            squads of Death Star troopers take up defensive positions throughout the sector. Death Star
                            trooper squads consist of a leader and seven troopers. Patrols can be avoided with Difficult sneak rolls.
                            All blast doors seal around the alerted area, requiring security rolls to open (the difficulty is
                            labeled by sector below). Increase the difficulty numbers of all locked doors (other than blast
                            doors) by another 7. If the security roll is less, the attempt fails and that character cannot make
                            another attempt on that door. If the security roll is half the difficulty number or less, the character
                            fails and sets off an alarm, immediately alerting a nearby patrol (roll a six-sided die: 1-2, security
                            patrol; 3-5, stormtrooper squad; 6, Death Star trooper squad).
                            Increase the difficulty numbers of all computer stations by another 7. If the computer programming roll is less, the attempt fails. If the roll
                            is half the difficulty number or less, the character fails and sets off an alarm, immediately alerting a
                            nearby patrol (roll a six-sided die: 1-2, security patrol; 3-5, stormtrooper squad; 6, Death Star

                    </ul>
                <p>Although sprawls are the physical basis of the Death Star organization, the difficulty of penetrating 
                    security and computer systems is dependent upon the type of sector the characters are in. The dificulties are based on Defstat Zero,
                    and represent the difficulty of simply accessing the Imperial computer system (characters with
                    appropriate rank cylinders do not need to make this roll).</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Rank_cylinders">
                <header>Rank cylinders</header>
            </section>
                <p>Rank cylinders are issued to Imperial officers and, if acquired by Rebels, can be very helpful in
                    navigating the Imperial computer network. Each rank cylinder has a specific entry code to insure
                    that only an authorized user is attempting to display sensitive information. Each rank cylinder is
                    labeled by sector, level of sensitivity and zone. Within its area of authority, a rank cylinder could
                    display any information. For example, a Zone N8 Moderate General rank cylinder would allow a user
                    with the appropriate access code to display and use any information from zone N8's general sector
                    of Moderate or lower difficulty. If the appropriate code is known there is no roll necessary to access
                    the information - it is automatically available. A character must make a Difficult security check to
                    falsify a code. However, if an incorrect code is entered other user attempts to access information
                    that is not authorized for the user, a warning is immediately relayed to the command sector for
                    the battle station and a full investigation begins shortly thereafter. A rank cylinder may also be
                    used in the same manner to aecess secured areas and doors. Rank cylinders are normally restricted
                    to access for just one vessel, or perhaps one portion of a vessel, but high-ranking officers, such as
                    Grand MoffTarkin, had rank cylinders that allowed them virtually unlimited access to any portion of
                    the battle station and a great amount of leeway within the entire Imperial network.</p>
                <p>Low-ranking officers (such as lieutenants and captains) have rank cylinders accessing Moderate 
                    information within their sector and zone. Officers of rank commander through colonel had
                    cylinders accessing up to Very Difficult information within their sector and zone and Very Easy
                    or Easy cylinders for other zones. Admirals and generals had Very Difficult cylinders for all sectors 
                    aboard their craft or fleet, while the Grand Moff had Very Difficult cylinders for all sectors
                    aboard the craft as well as at least Easy access to the entire Imperial network. The specific rank
                    cylinders allotted were determined by the particular officer's duties, and since these cylinders
                    were constantly monitored by security sector few officers were willing to abuse the power
                    entrusted to them</p>
                <p>Characters who somehow acquire rank cylinders may be in for an unpleasant surprise if they
                    are not cautious. Attempting to access unauthorized information or accessing data in a "suspicious" 
                    manner often alerts Imperial authorities in the zone bridge, the overbridge or one of the
                    security sectors. Since representatives from security are constantly monitoring the computer
                    systems of any Imperial facility, it is likely that such officers will be alerted to unauthorized
                    computer use unless the characters' efforts are inconspicuous.</p>
            <section class="main-section" id="Computer_programming_rolls">
                <header>Computer programming rolls</header>
                <p>Characters attempting to manipulate the Imperial computer network have their work cut out
                    for them. The Death Star's computer networkwas one of the most sophisticated and secure
                    ever constructed, and it is amazing to many Alliance researchers that R2-D2 was able to so
                    expertly extract information despite the assistance he gained from the Death Star's plans.
                    When a character attempts to manipulate anImperial computer terminal, he can have many
                    goals in mind. The most simple use of a terminal is to manipulate systems connected directly to
                    the terminal, such as doors or turbolifts controlled from the station. It is also fairly easy to
                    gain access to the work files used by the terminal. The computer programming difficulties listed on
                    page 23 (and repeated on the Computer Programming Flow Chart) reflect the difficulty of
                    merely accessing the Imperial computer network. Characters with the appropriate rank cylinder
                    and identification code can automatically access the data governed by the cylinder, but the cylinder 
                    is of no use for information above the clearance allowed by the cylinder (Very Ease, Easy,
                    Moderate, Difficult or Very Difficult), nor will it assist with information outside its authorized
                    sectors or zones. Gamemasters must determine at which box on the chart the data the characters
                    are seeking is stored.</p>
                <p>Once a character has made a successful computer programming roll to infiltrate the system (or
                    gotten in through a rank cylinder), he must also make computer programming rolls to extract information or use the system. The gamemaster
                    must set the difficulty for any action the characters attempt. For example, at Defstat Zero, it is a
                    Very Easy task to open up a General Sector turbolift, although if the station is at Defstat Two,
                    that task may become Easy. For another example, it may be Very Easy to get a duty roster
                    from a General Sector terminal, but Very Difficult to get a copy of Grand Moff Tarkin's itinerary.</p>

                <p>The sectors of the Death Star cover specific, detailed portions of the operation of the massive
                    battle station, and are designated by function: general, service/technical military, security, and command. Each zone also had a designated command sprawl called a bridge.
                    The bridges were responsible for gathering information and data from all other sprawls in
                    the zone. The bridge would then relay pertinent information to other zone bridges, the overbridge
                    (which ran the entire battle station) and sector command (which was responsible for coordinating all sector activities throughout the Death
                    Star). In this manner, each zone commander would be fully aware of what was happening
                    within his zone, while each sector commander would be fully informed about the efficiency and
                    activities of a particular sector throughout the battle station. The overbridge would draw upon both pools of information, and therefore had an
                    excellent overview of the station's functions.</p>
                <p>The two types of doors on the Death Star are regular doors and blast doors. If a character
                    doesn't want to be subtle, he can try to blast his way through a locked door or sealed blast door,
                    but this automatically alerts security to the intruder's presence. A regular door has a body of
                    3D. A blast door has a body of 6D. The character must get an incapacitated result to create a hole
                    large enough to step through.</p>
